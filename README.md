# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dougissi
My name is Doug Issichopoulos, and I am a Computer Science master's student at UIUC and formerly a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.humanyze.com" target="_blank">Humanyze</a>.
My background is in math (BS Mathematics, Stanford '12), so I strive to
write code that resembles a good math proof: 
easy to read, elegant, and water-tight.

Take a peek at my website <a href="https://www.dougissi.com" target="_blank">dougissi.com</a> to read posts are on software I've written that I believe would be useful to others
and/or demonstrate a particularly fun intersection of mathematics and computer science.

The easiest way to contact me is through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougissi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
