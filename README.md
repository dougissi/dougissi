# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dougissi
My name is Doug Issichopoulos, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/" target="_blank">Fortinet</a> (after they acquired <a href="https://www.lacework.com/" target="_blank">Lacework</a> in mid 2024). In 2023, I pursued a master's degree in computer science from UIUC where I focused primarily on distributed systems and machine learning. Prior to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.humanyze.com" target="_blank">Humanyze</a>. My undergraduate major was mathematics (Stanford '12), so it should be no surprise that I strive to write code that resembles a great math proof: easy to read, elegant, and water-tight.

Take a peek at my website <a href="https://www.dougissi.com" target="_blank">dougissi.com</a> to read posts on some of my personal software projects that I believe could be useful to others
and/or demonstrate a particularly fun intersection of mathematics and computer science.

The easiest way to contact me is through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougissi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
