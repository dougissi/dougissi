# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dougissi
My name is Doug Issichopoulos, and I am currently a Data Scientist at [Humanyze](https://www.humanyze.com).
My background is in math (BS Mathematics, Stanford '12), so I strive to
write code that resembles a good math proof: 
easy to read, elegant, and water-tight.

Take a peek at my website [dougissi.com](https://dougissi.com) to read posts are on software I've written that I believe would be useful to others
and/or demonstrate a particularly fun intersection of mathematics and computer science.

The easiest way to contact me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougissi/).
